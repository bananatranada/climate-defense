# Climate Defense

## Backstory
Mankind has neglected climate change for centuries, and they're beginning to face dire consequences. Defend each round of devastating disasters and undo the environmental damages caused by previous generations. 4 players are required to play.

## Objective
Defend all rounds of disasters.

## Setup
1. Place a human figure next to Round 1 on the Wave List board.
1. Place 10 lock cards in a straight line.
1. Place 10 life cards in a straight line.
1. Place object cards (e.g., towers, keys) to the side.
1. Shuffle and place resource cards face-down.
1. Each player draws a key and 5 random resource cards.

## Gameplay
Gameplay is separated into 2 phases: Preparation Phase and Defending Phase.

### Preparation Phase
Each player has a preparation phase. Once a player has completed their preparation phase, the next player (clockwise) begins theirs until all players have completed. Players cannot go back to a previous player's preparation phase.

At the start of the preparation phase, the player draws a random resource card. They can choose to combine cards, unlock tower slots using keys or place/upgrade towers.

### Defending Phase
Defending phase begins once every player has finished their preparation phase.

1. Place a dice below each card on the current round. Each dice must represent the number of health points on the card. If the card has more than 20 health points, use multiple die.
1. Place an evil faced figure on the first slot and traverse until it reaches a tower. If the tower is a basic tower, the players decide which single card to attack. Decrease the dice number by the damage it dealt. Non-basic towers may attack more than one cards, or no card at all. They may also have special abilities. Read the tower's description to apply them.
1. Move the evil faced figure until it reaches the next tower, and repeat.
1. If all the cards are destroyed, move the human figure to the next round and begin the preparation phase.
1. If one or more cards are alive by the time the evil faced figure moves past the last tower, flip that number of life cards backwards.

## Resource Cards
* Wind Energy
* Bio Energy
* Solar Energy
* Water Energy
* Geo Energy

## Combinations
* Key = Wind + Bio + Solar + Water + Geothermal
* Wind Turbine (Level 1) = Wind + Wind + Wind
* IDK (Critical hit: Roll a dice and do that amount of damage to a single target) = Geo + Geo + Geo + Solar + Solar
* IDK (Splash: Inflict damage to all targets) = Solar + Solar + Solar + Wind
* ADD MORE


TODO: Think of enemy card types (strengths and weaknesses), and what each energy's strengths and weaknesses are. Also some energies can be combined to a hybrid to become more all rounded.
